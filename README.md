## RV PARK

### THE PROBLEM
The owner of the RV park has done his reservation and payment system manually but with a successful business it has become tedious and inefficient to run the park this way. The customers arenâ€™t getting receipts or confirmation numbers and only have access to reservations during business hours. 

####  Problem, Targeted Users, Domain
In summary the problem is that the customers do not have complete accessibility or records to their reservations, and the owner is not able to keep a clean track of reservations writing them by hand with a thriving business.

The domain would be for travelers and RV enthusiasts within the DoD. Catering to the Lodging domain.

The targeted users would be people within the DOD or military or those with PCS looking for somewhere to reserve an RV spot. 

#### Existing applicaitons and their limitations
In previous modules we have completed systems such as an account registration, login, and logout. The report system for the owner and employees to view upcoming reservations is another system we have already implemented in other work. The transaction system would be very similar to the transactions we implemented in our previous system, the banking app. 

booking.com is a source for customers to access and create reservations ahead of time and pay online. 

recreation.gov is another source to make reservations, more specifically for camping and RVs. 

One limitation those sites may have is that they are catered to the general public, and may not have access for FamCamp to create their own system as they may be aimed for larger businesses. Having their own custom website could create a place meant specifically for their customers. 

#### Proposed Solution
The program will provide a reservation system for the customer to make an account and access and reserve available sites, pay for the reservation, and receive a receipt and confirmation number, as well as providing a report system for the owner and employees to view upcoming reservations
